			Oh! my heart,
			why do you feel pain?
			Oh! my heart,
			why do you love her?
			Oh! my heart,
			I can't bear this pain.
			Oh! my heart,
			This pain like anyone
			cutting my chest.
			Oh! my heart,
			Please, forget her.
			Oh! my heart,
			Life never wait for anyone.
			Oh! my heart,
			Surrender your heart to Allah.
			Oh! my heart,
			please, don't be pained.
			Oh! my heart,
			Head down to Allah;
			Only Allah can vanish your pain.
